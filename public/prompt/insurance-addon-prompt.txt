### SECTION 7: FAQ SECTION

**Common Questions:**

**Q: Do I need this if you already have insurance?**
A: Our standard service includes basic insurance, but CleanGuard Protection 
provides significantly higher coverage limits and additional protections like 
theft coverage, key replacement, and emergency services that standard coverage 
doesn't include.

**Q: Can I add insurance after I start my membership?**
A: Yes! Existing annual members can add CleanGuard Protection anytime. Coverage 
begins immediately upon approval and payment.

**Q: What if I cancel my cleaning membership?**
A: If you cancel your cleaning service, your insurance will be prorated and 
refunded for the unused portion. Insurance is only valid with active service.

**Q: Are there any exclusions?**
A: Yes. We don't cover intentional damage, normal wear and tear, pre-existing 
damage, or items valued over $10K (Basic), $50K (Premium), or $150K (Ultimate) 
unless registered in High-Value Registry.

**Q: How many claims can I file per year?**
A: There's no limit on the number of claims, but coverage limits apply per 
incident and annually for theft protection.

**Q: Does this cover damage I cause?**
A: No. This insurance covers damage or loss caused by our cleaning professionals 
during service. Your homeowner's insurance covers damage you cause.

**Q: What's the deductible?**
A: Basic plan: $100, Premium: $50, Ultimate: $0 deductible.
