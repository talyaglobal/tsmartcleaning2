## I. Residential Cleaning Services

Residential cleaning services are typically priced either by the hour or as a flat fee based on the size of the home (e.g., number of bedrooms and bathrooms).

### 1. Standard Cleaning
This is the most common service, usually performed on a recurring basis (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly). It covers general tidying, dusting, vacuuming, mopping floors, and cleaning surfaces in kitchens and bathrooms.

### 2. Deep Cleaning
A deep clean is more thorough than a standard clean, often recommended for a first-time service or for homes that have not been professionally cleaned in a while. It includes detailed work such as cleaning baseboards, interior windows, door frames, and deep scrubbing of kitchen and bathroom fixtures.

### 3. Move-Out/In Cleaning
This is the most intensive residential service, designed to prepare a property for a new occupant. It includes all deep cleaning tasks plus cleaning the inside of cabinets, drawers, ovens, and refrigerators.

## II. Corporate/Commercial Cleaning Services

Commercial cleaning services are often tailored to the specific needs of a business, with pricing models that reflect the scale and frequency of the work.

### 1. Per Square Foot Pricing
This is the most common method for large commercial spaces like offices, retail stores, and medical facilities. The price per square foot decreases as the total area increases, and it is heavily influenced by the required cleaning frequency (e.g., daily vs. weekly).

### 2. Hourly Pricing
Hourly rates are typically used for smaller offices, specialized tasks, or when the scope of work is variable and difficult to estimate with a flat fee.

### 3. Flat Fee for Small Offices
For small to medium-sized offices (e.g., under 5,000 sq. ft.), a fixed price per visit is often quoted, providing predictability for the client.

## IV. Key Factors Influencing Price

When determining a final price, cleaning companies consider several key variables:

*   **Geographic Location:** Costs are significantly higher in major metropolitan areas and areas with a high cost of living.
*   **Frequency:** Recurring services (e.g., weekly) are almost always discounted compared to one-time or occasional services.
*   **Property Size and Condition:** Larger spaces and properties requiring more intensive cleaning (e.g., pet hair, excessive clutter) will incur higher costs.
*   **Scope of Work:** Specialized services, such as window cleaning, carpet shampooing, or post-construction cleanup, are typically add-ons that increase the total price.
*   **Staffing Model:** Independent cleaners often charge less than large agencies that have higher overhead costs (insurance, bonding, employee benefits).
